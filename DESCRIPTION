Description: A comprehensive toolkit for processing JATOS data and conducting Bayesian 
    analyses in R. The package provides three main sets of functionality: 
    (1) Job Management: Intelligent background job scheduling, monitoring, and 
    resource management built on the 'job' package, with functions for parallel and 
    sequential model fit; (2) JATOS Data Processing: Tools for retrieving, organizing, 
    and preprocessing experimental data from JATOS, including API integration, metadata 
    enrichment, and JSON data handling; (3) Data Visualization and Manipulation: 
    Functions for data aggregation, plotting, and transformation with special support 
    for experimental designs in psychological research. The package streamlines the 
    workflow from raw experimental data to publication-ready analysis results, with 
    special focus on cognitive and psychological research data. While developed 
    primarily to enhance personal programming experience when conducting Bayesian 
    analyses, many functions can be useful in specific research contexts. This package 
    has been tested primarily on macOS and Linux systems.
