Description: A comprehensive toolkit for processing JATOS (Just Another Tool for 
    Online Studies) data and conducting Bayesian analyses in R. The package provides 
    three main sets of functionality: (1) Job Management: Intelligent background job 
    scheduling, monitoring, and resource management built on the 'job' package, with 
    functions for parallel and sequential model comparison; (2) JATOS Data Processing: 
    Tools for retrieving, organizing, and preprocessing experimental data from JATOS, 
    including API integration, metadata enrichment, and JSON data handling; (3) Bayesian 
    Analysis: Functions for model fitting with 'brms', data aggregation, formula 
    manipulation, and advanced post-processing including Bayes factor computation and 
    pairwise comparisons. The package streamlines the workflow from raw experimental 
    data to publication-ready Bayesian analysis results, with special focus on cognitive 
    and psychological research data. While developed primarily to enhance personal 
    programming experience when conducting Bayesian analyses, many functions can be 
    useful in specific research contexts. This package has been tested primarily on 
    macOS and Linux systems.
