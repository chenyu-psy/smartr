\title{Aggregate Data for Plotting (Between/Within-Subject Design)}
\usage{
agg_plot(
  data,
  y,
  between = NULL,
  within = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  ci = 0.95,
  zero.rm = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the data to be aggregated.}

\item{y}{The variable to be aggregated (string or unquoted variable name).}

\item{between}{Between-subject factor(s) (string, unquoted variable name, or tidyselect expression). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{within}{Within-subject factor(s) (string, unquoted variable name, or tidyselect expression). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{group}{Subject/grouping variable(s) (string, unquoted variable name, or tidyselect expression). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{ci}{Confidence interval level (between 0 and 1). Default is \code{0.95}.}

\item{zero.rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, removes cases where mean and sd are both zero. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns: mean, n, se, ci, and grouping variables.
}
\description{
Aggregates data for plotting by computing the mean, standard error, and confidence interval.
Supports both between-subject and within-subject factors, and applies Morey correction for within-subject designs.
