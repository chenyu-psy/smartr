\title{Aggregate Data for Plotting}
\usage{
agg_plot(
  data,
  y,
  between = NULL,
  within = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  ci = 0.95,
  zero.rm = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the data to be aggregated.}

\item{y}{The variable to be aggregated (can be a string or tidyverse-style variable).}

\item{between}{The between-subject factor (can be a string or tidyverse-style variable). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{within}{The within-subject factor (can be a string or tidyverse-style variable). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{group}{The grouping variable (can be a string or tidyverse-style variable). Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{ci}{The confidence interval level. Default is \code{0.95}.}

\item{zero.rm}{Logical indicating whether to remove cases where the mean and standard deviation are both zero. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the aggregated data with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: The mean of the aggregated variable.
\item \code{n}: The number of observations.
\item \code{se}: The standard error of the mean.
\item \code{ci}: The confidence interval.
}
}
\description{
This function aggregates data for plotting by computing the mean, standard error, and confidence interval. It supports both between-subject and within-subject factors, and includes adjustments for within-subject variability (e.g., Morey correction).

\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- data.frame(
  subject = rep(1:10, each = 2),
  condition = rep(c("A", "B"), times = 10),
  score = rnorm(20)
)
agg_plot(data, y = score, between = condition, group = subject)
}
