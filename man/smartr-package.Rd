\title{smartr: Smart Ways to Run Bayesian Models on JATOS Data}
\description{
A comprehensive toolkit for processing JATOS data and conducting Bayesian analyses in R. The package provides three main sets of functionality: (1) Job Management: Intelligent background job scheduling, monitoring, and resource management built on the 'job' package, with functions for parallel and sequential model fit; (2) JATOS Data Processing: Tools for retrieving, organizing, and preprocessing experimental data from JATOS, including API integration, metadata enrichment, and JSON data handling; (3) Data Visualization and Manipulation: Functions for data aggregation, plotting, and transformation with special support for experimental designs in psychological research. The package streamlines the workflow from raw experimental data to publication-ready analysis results, with special focus on cognitive and psychological research data. While developed primarily to enhance personal programming experience when conducting Bayesian analyses, many functions can be useful in specific research contexts. This package has been tested primarily on macOS and Linux systems.
