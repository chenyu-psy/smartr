\title{smartr: Smart Ways to Run Bayesian Models on JATOS Data}
\description{
A comprehensive toolkit for processing JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) data and conducting Bayesian analyses in R. The package provides three main sets of functionality: (1) Job Management: Intelligent background job scheduling, monitoring, and resource management built on the 'job' package, with functions for parallel and sequential model comparison; (2) JATOS Data Processing: Tools for retrieving, organizing, and preprocessing experimental data from JATOS, including API integration, metadata enrichment, and JSON data handling; (3) Bayesian Analysis: Functions for model fitting with 'brms', data aggregation, formula manipulation, and advanced post-processing including Bayes factor computation and pairwise comparisons. The package streamlines the workflow from raw experimental data to publication-ready Bayesian analysis results, with special focus on cognitive and psychological research data. While developed primarily to enhance personal programming experience when conducting Bayesian analyses, many functions can be useful in specific research contexts. This package has been tested primarily on macOS and Linux systems.
